This section presents an architecture and execution environment to put together 
semantics and existing techniques for dealing with data streams in real-time. 
It is based on the architecture defined in~\cite{BigDataManing} by Nathan Marz that defines 
a general data system as a system that runs arbitrary functions on arbitrary data. This definition 
follows the next equation $query=f(all\,data)$ which is the basis of all systems. The Lambda 
Architectures defines then a clear set of principles to build robust and scalable data 
systems obeying the aforementioned equation. Basically three main design principles 
can be found:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Human fault-tolerance. The system is unsusceptible to data loss or data corruption because at scale it could be irreparable.
 \item Data immutability. Data is stored in a raw form to be immutable and for perpetuity.
 \item Re-computation. Following the two previous principles it is always possible 
 to re-compute results by performing a function on the raw data.
\end{itemize}

In order to depict a semantic-based framework for QoS management that can leverage existing datastream processing 
tools such as those presented in Section~\ref{data-stream} and improve/boost the user experience (technicians and business users), 
we present in Figure~\ref{fig:qos-framework} the building blocks to implement a semantic ``WatchDog''~\cite{watchdog} cloud pattern. This framework is build 
upon any cloud to manage and control QoS indicators. As any knowledge-based system it comprises a knowledge layer in which 
ontologies are used to represent a QoS model and the quality functions to be deployed on the monitoring tool. The formalization of a 
QoS model is not an easy task since a lot of tries have been already done, see Section~\ref{qos-semantics}. Nevertheless the 
effort of the CSMIC consortium in the creation of the SMI index, see Section~\ref{qos-cloud-index}, represents a good starting point to unify quality indicators 
and metrics. Thus the proposed framework can be seen as an implementation of the SMI index but modeling the index (structure and computation process) 
using semantic web technologies such as SPARQL and the RDF Data Cube vocabulary (a W3C recommendation to represent statistical data). 
The second layer outlines some required capabilities to support lowering and lifting processes~\cite{DBLP:journals/jucs/RodriguezRMPGP12} 
between the abstract QoS model and the real execution in the monitoring tool. Since SPARQL queries can be translated into SQL (or Pig~\cite{Schatzle:2011:PMS:1999299.1999303}) queries 
it is obvious than any execution framework supporting a SQL-based language (or Apache Hadoop) can execute our semantic model generating new observations in RDF. Furthermore a dashboard is also provided to manage quality indicators. In this case 
tools such as CubeViz enable the automatic visualization of RDF Data Cube observations easing the creation and customization of the graphical interface.

On the other hand Figure~\ref{fig:lambda-qos} outlines the layers of the Lambda architecture (in this case the monitoring tool) with 
an adaptation to support semantics. 

\begin{itemize}
 \item \textbf{Batch layer.} It contains immutable, constantly growing dataset stored on a distributed file system like HDFS. This layer 
 receives as input the raw data coming from a queue. Data is then computed by means of some function and results are finally exposed 
 as batch views. As an extra step and with the aim of supporting the use of semantics these final views are promoted as RDF and thus SPARQL queries 
 can be executed on the computed results. This approach of adding an extra layer to ease queries over batch views has been 
 already address using SQL as a formal query language, e.g. SploutSQL. In this case SPARQL and RDF is selected to support the implicit 
 creation of queries from a semantic model. This layer is usually implemented using a MapReduce-based framework such as Apache Hadoop or 
 a more high-level framework such as Apache Pig. A final remark in this layer lies in the off-line execution of the algorithms or functions 
 that eases the pre-computation of results when large dataset processing is required.
 
 \item \textbf{Serving layer.} The responsibility of this layer is to manage both batch and real-time views 
 with the aim of providing a way of querying and merging both views and populate results to be consumed by 
 a third-service. In this case, this layer is in charge of executing the SPARQL queries (using a federated extension~\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/RakhmawatiUKHH13} 
 such as SPARQL-FedX~\cite{DBLP:conf/esws/SchwarteHHSS11}) and publish the results as RDF. At a first glance this job does not require 
 random writers but must support batch updates and random reads. In this case the implementation of joining 
 results is also designed as a Storm/Trident topology to enable and distributed real-time updates.
%  However it can be extraordinarily simple (candidates could be ElephantDB or Voldemort).

\item \textbf{Speed layer.} It deals with new data to compensate or decrease the latency of the batch layer. 
Functions are deployed on some stream processing system such as Storm, S4 or Spark and results are finally 
exposed as RDF. The functionality provided by this layer is mainly the same as the batch-layer but removing 
the latency and affording a real-time query system. Once data is also processed and available in the batch 
view a synchronization process must remove data from the real-time views. In this case Apache Zookepper 
can be used to keep synchronization in a distributed system.
\end{itemize}

The ``semantized'' Lambda Architecture using RDF and SPARQL on top of the batch and real-time views enables 
the possibility of handling the complexity of Big Data systems by defining a clear set of principles. Specifically 
the use of semantics serve to integrate data under a common data model that can be queried using a formal 
query language such as SPARQL. Furthermore immutability, human fault-tolerance and re-computation basic principles 
that can be easily adopted with the Hadoop platform. Finally and depending on the real-time requirements of 
the system some parts can be omitted and integrated in a further stage.
