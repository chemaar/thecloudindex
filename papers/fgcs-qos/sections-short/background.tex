This section presents a brief summary of the background concepts reviewed in this paper: 
1) Cloud Computing and QoS; 2) Semantic Technologies and 3) Big Data, with the 
aim of building a common understanding of the requirements of QoS in Cloud Computing.


\subsection{Quality of Service in Cloud Systems}\label{qos-cloud-index}
\input{sections/qos-cloud}
\subsection{Semantic Technologies}
\input{sections/semantics}
\subsection{Big Data}
\input{sections/big-data}

Since the core concepts of this review are presented, it is clear that semantic 
web technologies offer a standard and unified way for representing information 
and data coming from cloud-based applications. QoS management processes can 
take advantage of this situation building expert systems that exploit this data to support the aforementioned five 
key-characteristics of Cloud Computing providing an intelligent and flexible environment for 
self-managed applications in which both profiles technicians and business users can use 
semantics and real-time systems as a tool for supporting their decisions.
