\section{Conclusions and Future work}\label{sect:conclusions}
An important body of work has been done during the last five years regarding the
deployment of cloud infrastructures, services and applications. As a result,
numerous SaaS, PaaS and IaaS providers can found as well as cloud management
platforms to ease the management of these infrastructures. In the same way, the
definition of QoS features in SOA has become a major research topic with a lot
of derived works trying to model and manage applying different approaches as
ontologies, rule based systems, etc. The arrival of new techniques for
processing real-time large and diverse datastreams from different data sources
to deliver ontology-based expert systems is very promising and the Cloud
Computing and the QoS management areas must take advantage of these methods to exploit cloud
infrastructures saving costs, being efficient and greener. Further steps require
the definition of a QoS model for cloud infrastructures and the design of
scalable infrastructures for connecting and managing resources on the cloud. The
market and business opportunities of this new realm are encouraging the research and the
collaboration between the academic and industrial areas fostering both the open
issues and the generated know-how among all interested parties.
