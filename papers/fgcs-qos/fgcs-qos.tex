\begin{abstract}
% The concept of Service Oriented Computing have seen a dramatic increase of the amount of applications, 
% services, management platforms, data, etc. gaining momentum in Information and Communication Technology and more 
% specifically in the deployment of the Future Internet. However this explosion 
% implies the necessity of new complex methods and techniques to deal with the 
% vast heterogeneity of data sources, services or platforms. In this sense Quality 
% of Service (QoS) seeks for providing an intelligent environment of self-management components based on domain knowledge 
% in which both functional and nonfunctional properties of cloud components can be optimized in terms of 
% cost, efficiency or reliability easing the transition to an advanced resource 
% provisioning process. On the other hand, semantics and Linked Data and ontologies have emerged 
% to afford a common and standard data model that eases the interoperability, integration and monitoring of 
% knowledge-based systems. Taking into account the necessity of an interoperable and intelligent system to manage 
% QoS in Cloud Systems and the emerging application of semantics in different domains, this paper reviews the 
% main approaches for semantic-based QoS management as well as the principal methods, techniques and standards for 
% processing and exploiting diverse data providing advanced real-time monitoring services. 
% A semantic-based framework is also outlined taking into account the QoS requirements and capabilities of semantic technologies and distributed 
% datastream processing techniques. Finally a discussion of existing efforts and challenges are also 
% provided to suggest future directions.
Cloud Computing and Service Oriented Architectures have seen a dramatic increase of the amount of applications, 
services, management platforms, data, etc. gaining momentum the necessity of new complex methods 
and techniques to deal with the vast heterogeneity of data sources or services. In this sense Quality of Service (QoS) 
seeks for providing an intelligent environment of self-management components based on domain knowledge in which 
cloud components can be optimized easing the transition to an advanced governance environment. On the other hand, 
semantics and ontologies have emerged to afford a common and standard data model that eases the interoperability, integration and 
monitoring of knowledge-based systems. Taking into account the necessity of an interoperable and intelligent system to manage QoS in 
cloud-based Systems and the emerging application of semantics in different domains, this paper reviews the main approaches for 
semantic-based QoS management as well as the principal methods, techniques and standards for processing and exploiting diverse data 
providing advanced real-time monitoring services. A semantic-based framework for QoS management is also outlined taking advantage of 
semantic technologies and distributed datastream processing techniques. Finally a discussion of existing efforts and challenges are 
also provided to suggest future directions.
