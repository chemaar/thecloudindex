% Cloud brokers — emerging cloud services
% brokers simplify an organization’s
% transition to the cloud by helping to

% Accelerants
% Emergence of cloud service “brokers”
% Cloud service aggregators, or brokers,
% are already beginning to emerge to help
% organizations overcome their initial lack of
% experience in managing CSPs, especially for
% situations in which multiple CSPs may be
% required.2 Service aggregators sit between
% the cloud and the client to actually package
% all of the services based on the needs of
% the organization. They then manage the
% governance and the service levels for the
% organization. Venture capital (VC) funding
% is accelerating this trend. VCs wish to
% participate in the cloud opportunity but
% generally try to avoid capital-intensive
% businesses that require massive data
% centers, such as have been constructed
% by Amazon, Google, Microsoft and others
% for the provision of cloud services. Service
% aggregators are a more natural fit for
% VC funding.
