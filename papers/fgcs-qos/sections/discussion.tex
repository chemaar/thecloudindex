Despite the growing interest in Cloud Computing [102, 103] and the hype of this new paradigm for the creation of new era of applications, services and data available through the Web, a real advanced cloud management environment is far from being fully developed. There are many open issues to be solved and technology to ease the transition from traditional developments and applications to a cloud-based environment is still under development. With regards to QoS, there are a lot of initiatives and efforts trying to model and manage functional and non-functional properties in an intelligent fashion. Nevertheless the lack of standards for unifying information and data is preventing the deployment of advanced techniques for QoS management. In the case of semantic technologies, works in different areas are emerging to solve interoperability and integration problems in distributed environments. More specifically, the creation of knowledge-based systems applying semantic-based techniques as stream reasoning and CEP are currently being developed to deal mainly with Big Data problems in the context of social media or e-Government. Following a list of particular comments to discuss are presented:
\begin{itemize}
 \item There are a big variety of QoS dimensions to ensure in a cloud system. The methods to ensure reliability, security and trust should be modeled and discovered in automatic ways. In this specific case it is also required to take into account user feedback to evaluate the real quality and trust of a service. Moreover, depending on the cloud layer, specific QoS characteristics should be defined to collect the requirements of each particular case. Currently QoS approaches are mainly focused on web service discovery and selection but new ranking methods and reactive control systems taking into QoS features should be deployed to provide an intelligent cloud infrastructure.  
 \item Information about a service consists in both static and dynamic data, the matchmaking of services according to these issues is a key-enabler for a real QoS management but it is not fully addressed by existing works.
 \item According to Table  the big variety of ontologies, OWL models, etc. that have been designed in recent years imply a tangled set of options that should be unified to provide an unique view of  what QoS should be. Apart from that the use of semantics is not clear, in some cases reasoning processes are used to discover services but others just define an ontology as a proposal to provide a formal model without any real application. A clear semantic-based architecture [104, 105] should be defined containing the adequate definitions [106].of functional and non-functional properties.
 \item With regards to Semantic Web and reasoning, there is a growing community trying to provide technology for supporting intelligent systems in the new Web of Data. As a consequence the necessity of dealing with Big Data problems and data coming from different sources is stimulating the creation of new approaches to reuse existing technology such as Apache Hadoop in the context of querying large datasets. Therefore the main application of the Semantic Web principles lies in the unification of data and the execution of reasoning processes to validate data and infer new facts. Nevertheless, the existing logic formalisms available in OWL such as DL, FOL, F-Logic, etc. do not seem to be a solution to tackle the challenge of modeling dynamic domains that is why some works [107] regarding Continuous Semantics are emerging.
 \item A research area that is expected to play a key-role to enrich information is Linked Data. Currently this initiative has been successfully applied to information retrieval systems or in the creation of rich user interfaces. Nevertheless, the expectations of linking different datasets to enrich information are growing as a manner for delivering more intelligent services. To apply Linked Data in the Cloud Computing environment we should ensure that any resource to be monitored has an URI, its data is coded into RDF according to a formal model, an API or endpoint is accessible for fetching data using pulling pushing or triggering techniques and the methods for graph processing and reasoning are efficient and scalable under real-time constraints.
 
\end{itemize}

As main future challenge among others [108, 109], Semantics can help to increase the reliability in Cloud Computing providing the building blocks and models for an advanced QoS management. In the same way, Cloud Computing can help semantic technologies to be more scalable and flexible making use of the web as infrastructure to create large-scale data-intensive batch applications [110].
